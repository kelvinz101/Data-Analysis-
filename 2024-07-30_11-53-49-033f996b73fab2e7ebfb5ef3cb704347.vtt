In today's tutorial, we are going to cover a topic that can be incredibly useful when you are working

00:07.100 --> 00:13.400
with the data formatting, merging, and splitting cells in Excel.

00:13.400 --> 00:21.890
Whether you are organizing data, creating reports, or designing tables, knowing how to merge and

00:21.980 --> 00:26.570
space cells effectively can save you a lot of time and effort.

00:26.570 --> 00:29.540
So so let's dive right in.

00:30.050 --> 00:33.710
So first step let's talk about the merging cells.

00:34.700 --> 00:44.090
So merging cells in Excel allows you to combine two or more cells into a single larger cell.

00:44.120 --> 00:55.080
This can be a handy for creating endings and labels or formattings or uh, like uh that are formatting

00:55.080 --> 00:55.890
tables.

00:55.890 --> 00:58.800
So let me show you how it's done.

00:58.800 --> 00:59.430
Okay.

01:00.750 --> 01:08.760
So like here, if you want to use something about like the informations or info or this one, I will

01:08.760 --> 01:10.200
just want to use it.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.470
This is kind of the info under the info.

01:13.500 --> 01:18.570
I want to use this one as the like the name and also the age over here.

01:18.610 --> 01:21.430
Okay, so now here I go.

01:21.460 --> 01:25.360
If I want to use also our maps.

01:25.360 --> 01:29.980
Also those those two cells over here, I can easily do it.

01:29.980 --> 01:36.130
First one you need to select the cell and go to the home tab on the Excel ribbon.

01:38.710 --> 01:47.910
Now look for the Merge and Center button in the island group okay, so click on the arrow next to it

01:47.910 --> 01:48.270
okay.

01:48.270 --> 01:55.080
So and you will see a few options which is align and the content of the middle or more cells.

01:55.950 --> 02:03.750
And also the uh like you can you will find the merge across or the merge cells over here.

02:04.170 --> 02:04.950
Okay.

02:05.550 --> 02:10.760
Uh I will just use the UC or the merge and the center for now.

02:10.760 --> 02:12.020
Click over here.

02:12.020 --> 02:12.650
Okay.

02:12.650 --> 02:20.540
So you see the the selected cells are merged into a single cells within a content center.

02:21.320 --> 02:22.820
It's a simple as that.

02:22.820 --> 02:23.390
Okay.

02:24.710 --> 02:30.050
If I want to make it in a single row I want to make it the single row.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.500
This one I can just click over here.

02:32.590 --> 02:36.940
Marcia Sanders, you can now see it comes over the singles row over here.

02:37.960 --> 02:41.560
Now let's talk about the splitting cells.

02:42.250 --> 02:48.640
Splitting cells LLC to divide a single cell into multiple cells.

02:48.850 --> 02:55.990
This can be useful for the separating data and adjusting layout of your spreadsheets.

02:56.140 --> 02:57.900
Let me demonstrate.

02:58.140 --> 03:00.390
So spelled your.

03:00.780 --> 03:01.200
First.

03:01.200 --> 03:04.650
You need to select the cells that you want to split.

03:04.650 --> 03:11.850
Like if I want to merge or if I want to spell this one, then go back to the again and to the merge

03:11.850 --> 03:15.630
and center server into the alignment group on the home tab.

03:15.750 --> 03:24.500
And this time, instead of the selecting Merge and center, click on the arrow row and next to it choose

03:24.500 --> 03:26.450
the unmarked cells.

03:26.480 --> 03:33.980
Okay, so Excel will automatically spill the merge cells back to the its original individual cells over

03:33.980 --> 03:34.610
here.

03:35.030 --> 03:41.570
And if I want to use also this one then go to the over here and use the Our cells index.

03:41.570 --> 03:49.410
So depending the on the content layout of your spreadsheets, you may need to adjust the columns and

03:49.710 --> 03:50.190
width.

03:50.190 --> 03:55.050
Uh, after splitting cells ensure anything uh, fits nicely.

03:55.080 --> 03:58.590
You can do this by clicking and dragging, like here.

03:58.590 --> 04:05.400
Or you can just drag in the columns under it to resize it, or you can easily make it or you can easily

04:05.400 --> 04:06.060
adjust it.

04:06.060 --> 04:06.630
Okay.

04:06.630 --> 04:12.410
So and there you have it, uh, you have learned how to merge and expelled cells in it.

04:12.410 --> 04:19.580
So these are essential techniques that can help you format your data more effectively and makes your

04:19.640 --> 04:21.890
spreadsheets looks more professional.

04:21.890 --> 04:30.140
So practicing using this feature in your own Excel project and will be coming or becoming a formation

04:30.140 --> 04:32.180
or formatting in no time.

04:32.180 --> 04:35.630
So thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video.
